## Startup Spec Notes

I have been learning a lot about how to use github. I have used github for several classes, but most of the time, I have no idea what is going on. The repositories in this course that have gone over some of the basics, especially those towards cloning forking and making branches, of github have helped me understand more in depth and more clearly how this actually works and how to use it effectively. 

## AWS Notes

There is so much that I have learned with this. I have been learning a great deal about how webservers work, and just the internet in general. It is also exciting to get a webserver running.

## HTML Notes

I have a little bit of experience with html, so it has been really nice to review the different aspects of the language and all the little specifications that I make when working with it.

## CSS Notes

I did not realize that you could put the CSS directly into an html file. It definitely makes more sense for it to be in its own file, but, having never used CSS to date, this was a surprise to me. I loved learning about all of the neat tricks that one can do when working with CSS to make their website look how they want it. I also didn't know how to use the developer tools when debugging.
