## Startup Spec Notes

I have been learning a lot about how to use github. I have used github for several classes, but most of the time, I have no idea what is going on. The repositories in this course that have gone over some of the basics, especially those towards cloning forking and making branches, of github have helped me understand more in depth and more clearly how this actually works and how to use it effectively. 

## AWS Notes

There is so much that I have learned with this. I have been learning a great deal about how webservers work, and just the internet in general. It is also exciting to get a webserver running.

## HTML Notes

I have a little bit of experience with html, so it has been really nice to review the different aspects of the language and all the little specifications that I make when working with it.

## CSS Notes

I did not realize that you could put the CSS directly into an html file. It definitely makes more sense for it to be in its own file, but, having never used CSS to date, this was a surprise to me. I loved learning about all of the neat tricks that one can do when working with CSS to make their website look how they want it. I also didn't know how to use the developer tools when debugging.

## JavaScript Notes



## React Notes

JSX is a combination of javascript and html
>>> const jsx = <p>Hello World</p>
The above JSX will be converted into javascript when compiled with Babel
us brackets to escape jsx rendering:
>>> <div>
>>>     <p>Hello {phrase}</p>
>>> </div>
A multi-page application will have to load a different page for each part of the app you want, with react, we can make it that it is always the same page but the main component changes as the user navigates. This way it won't have to reload a page each time they navigate, and we have our header and footer consistent throughout the app. It uses NavLinks as our anchor tags and will route to different route components. <Routes> will be a set of all possible route paths. 
This may be the most difficult topic for me to understand and grasp just yet, this will take a lot of expirimentation.
