# Group Meetup Organizer

[My Notes](notes.md)

This web app will make it easy for users to not only organize group meetups, but also for people looking for a group to find groups in their area. Users can publish public groups that are open invitations, or they can create private groups in which they'll share the invitation with those they want to invite.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown - I have been practicing my markdown as I've never used it before:)
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - I wrote my elevator pitch (still working on catching an elevator with Steve Jobs)
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

<!-- I love boardgames! Do you love boardgames? No? Oh. Well I've been having a difficult time finding others who want to play boardgames. Has this ever happened to you? You have an interest and you want to share this interest with someone else, but you struggle to find people with those same interests! I just wish there was an app where one could publish a meetup for a particular activity, and others in their area can see this event and meetup to find other people with this interest! It would be so simple to share information about a group bike ride, or an open board game night.  -->

Imagine an app that allows you to easily share info about group meetups in your area. Say you're hosting a D&D campaign and you need more players. Or you love riding bikes and you want to start a weekly group ride. Or perhaps you're wanting to find new hobbies and friends, but don't know where to start. This app would allow people to create groups that others in their area can view the meetup info and can show interest in particular activities in their area. It would make it so simple to find and make new friend groups with similar interests!

### Design

![Login image](images/startup.mock.login.png) ![Home image](images/startup.mock.home.png) ![Group image](images/startup.mock.group.png)

Users will create an account they can login with, ideally these accounts would be linked to their phone number so they can opt in on recieving text message reminders for events they've shown interest in or rsvp'd for. On the home page, users will see all nearby public events, and any private events they may be invited to. Users will be able to view the details of any group they select, such as the time and location of the next meetup, as well as a description of the group itself, the creator, and any other potentially important information
